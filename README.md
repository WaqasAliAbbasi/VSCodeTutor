                               FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE
```

Visual Studio Code is a powerful and easy to use text editor. You can start
using the editor without knowing any details, which is great for beginners.

I had been using VSCode for a long time until I realized I could save time by
using shortcuts for stuff I repeatedly do. I looked up a few but looking at
long videos, articles and lists was too much for me to remember.
I wanted something interactive where I could learn by doing.

I came upon [Sublime Tutor](https://sublimetutor.com/) which was exactly
what I was looking for. It just wasn't made for VSCode. I still downloaded
the tutor and went through the chapters. Wherever the shortcuts didn't
work, I just looked up the ones for VSCode and modified the instructions.
That is what led to VSCode Tutor.

It's inspired from classic vimtutor and built upon [Sublime Tutor](https://sublimetutor.com/).
It was originally built by Jai Pandya (hello@jai.im) for Sublime Text 3 and
has been modified for VSCode by me.

You will learn some handy shortcuts to work with Visual Studio Code. By the
end of this tutorial, you would be familiar with VSCode's most important and
frequently used shortcuts and features.

The tutorial uses spaced repetition technique to make sure that your newly
acquired skills are well persisted.
