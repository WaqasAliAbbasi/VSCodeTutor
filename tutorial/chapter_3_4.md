# Select word with multiple occurrences

- Select word once - `Cmd + D`
- Select occurrences of this word - Press `Cmd + D` multiple times for each
  occurrence

If you want to quickly select all the occurrences of a word, this shortcut
could come in handy. Put the cursor on the word that needs to be selected,
now press `Cmd + D` as many times as it appears in the document. This puts us
in multiple cursor mode and we do some editing operations on the selected
occurrences.

## Exercise

In the block given below, select all the occurrences of the word `phone`
and change it to `android`.

1. Place your cursor on the word `phone`.
2. Press `Cmd + D` as many times as it appears in the list.
3. Once all of them are selected, delete them and replace with `android`.
