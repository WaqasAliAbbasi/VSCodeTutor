# Conclusion

Congratulations! This concludes the course for you. You spent hours with VSCode
Tutor, learning new features and shortcuts supported by VSCode. I hope you
had a good experience navigating through the course and it would result in an
increased productivity next time when you use Visual Studio Code for any work.

From here, I would recommend you to practice all the shortcuts as much as
possible. Take a print-out of a good visual studio code cheat sheet and keep it with
you while working.
