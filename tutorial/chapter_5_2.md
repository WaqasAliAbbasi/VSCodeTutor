Replace
========

Find is incomplete without replace and vice versa.

There would always be cases when you would want to search for a specific term
and get it replaced with some other term. In such cases, this shortcut would
come in handy.

* Replace panel - `Cmd + Option + F`
* Replace next - `Enter`
* Replace all - `Command + Enter` (Only when replace panel is open)
