                               FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE
```

Visual Studio Code is a powerful and easy to use text editor. You can start
using the editor without knowing any details, which is great for beginners.

I had been using VSCode for a long time until I realized I could save time by
using shortcuts for stuff I repeatedly do. I looked up a few but looking at
long videos, articles and lists was too much for me to remember.
I wanted something interactive where I could learn by doing.

I came upon Sublime Tutor which was exactly what I was looking for. It just
wasn't made for VSCode. I still downloaded the tutor and went through the
chapters. Wherever the shortcuts didn't work, I just looked up the ones for
VSCode.

This tutorial is inspired from classic vimtutor and built upon Sublime Tutor.
It was originally built by Jai Pandya (hello@jai.im) for Sublime Text 3 and
has been modified for VSCode.

You will learn some handy shortcuts to work with Visual Studio Code. By the
end of this tutorial, you would be familiar with VSCode's most important and
frequently used shortcuts and features.

The tutorial uses spaced repetition technique to make sure that your newly
acquired skills are well persisted.


Symbols Used in this guide
---------------------------

    Cmd – the Command Key symbol
    Ctrl - the Control Key symbol
    Option – the Option Key symbol
    Shift – the Shift Key symbol
    Esc – the Escape Key symbol
    Return – the Return symbol
    Delete – the Delete / Backspace symbol


Getting Started
----------------

Tip: Invoke Visual Studio Code from command line:

Follow instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

Now you can use `code` command in your terminal to open Visual Studio Code. If
you put a `.` after the command, it will open the current directory in VSCode.

    $ code

or

    $ code .


Navigate to the first chapter
------------------------------

The first feature you'll learn is 'Goto anything' shortcut. Use `Cmd + P` and
then type `1`, this would give you a list of files matched. Select
the first option (`1.md`) using `Down` arrow key followed by `Return`.
