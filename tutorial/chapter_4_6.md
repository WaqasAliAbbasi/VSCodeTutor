# Code folding / unfolding

When you are working with nested code structures, you can see a folded view
of your code to get a larger picture.

- Fold one level - `Cmd + Option + [`
- Unfold code one level - `Cmd + Option + ]`

## Exercise

Let's try this with the following HTML code structure.

1. Open `chapter_1.ts`.
2. Put your cursor inside any of the inner functions.
3. Use the `Fold one level` shortcut `Cmd + Option + [`
4. While `Cmd` and `Option` keys are depressed, press `[` key multiple times
   so that whole code structure is completely folded.
5. Now use the shortcut for unfolding code `Cmd + Option + ]`.
