# Search symbol in project

- Shortcut - `Cmd + T`

When you open a project in VSCode, it automatically starts indexing
symbols defined in it. As a result, when you fire this command, it
automatically shows you a list of symbols in the project, you can filter the
symbol of your choice using fuzzy search in this box.

You can try this shortcut right now to get the list of symbols in this project.
(Which should be the code you explored in the first unit only)
