# Split block of text selection into multiple lines

If you need a cursor on each line in a region, then VSCode provides one
more way of doing it. Drag select a region of text, then press `Shift + Option + I`
This splits it into one selection per line.

Combine it with `fn + left/right` and you can go to beginning or end of any line.

Let's try this in practice by following the same exercise from the previous
units.

## Exercise

In the list given below add an asterisk followed by space (`*`) at the
beginning of each item.

1. Drag select the whole block (from first item to the last one)
2. Press `Shift + Option + I`, this splits the selections into multiple lines.
3. Press `fn + left` to move the cursor to the beginning of the lines.
4. Now type `*` (asterisk followed by space) to complete the exercise.
