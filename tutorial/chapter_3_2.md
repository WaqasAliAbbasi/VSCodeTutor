# Column Selection

If you want to have multiple cursors in a column, then `Option + click`
could become cumbersome pretty soon. For this, there is a more convenient
method that VSCode provides.

- Keyboard shortcut - `Command + Option + up|down`

## Exercise

Following on from the exercise in unit 1, do the same thing again but this
time using column selection keyboard shortcut. In the list given below add an
asterisk followed by space (`*`) in the beginning of each item. Put your
cursor at the beginning of the word `tab`. Then press `Control + Shift + down`.
This will put you into column selection mode, and keep selecting more rows on
column 1 as you keep pressing the `down` arrow key. Once the first column of
every item is selected, start typing `*` (asterisk followed by space).

```

tab
caps lock
