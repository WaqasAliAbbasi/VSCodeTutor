Soft Undo / Redo
=================

Shortcuts for `undo` and `redo` commands are `Cmd + Z` and `Cmd + Shift + Z`
which is a standard on Mac. But here, we are talking about 'soft' undo and redo
actions.

VSCode has the ability to track your cursor position in the history. So, when
you move your cursor from one position to another, or select something, VSCode
can easily undo these 'soft' actions as well.

Shortcut for soft undo is: `Cmd + U`

Exercise
